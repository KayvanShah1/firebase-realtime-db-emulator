## About
FireMongo is a project aimed at integrating the functionalities of Firebase Realtime Database with the robust querying and indexing capabilities of MongoDB. The goal is to create a seamless data management system that leverages the strengths of both databases while emulating the RESTful functionalities of Firebase. This project was developed to simplify data operations, enhance data retrieval efficiency, and provide a flexible yet powerful backend for various applications.

## Description

### Main Features

1. **Data Model Design**: Implemented a data model that effectively utilizes MongoDB's querying and indexing features while replicating the JSON structure of Firebase.
2. **RESTful API Endpoints**: Developed comprehensive RESTful API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to manage data operations seamlessly, emulating Firebase's CRUD functionalities.
3. **Rules Configuration**: Configured and managed rules for setting indexes and modifying them to ensure data integrity and optimize query performance.
4. **Automatic API Documentation**: Utilized OpenAPI specification for automatic API documentation, making it easy for developers to understand and use the API.
5. **Deployment**: Deployed the application using Docker and Okteto Cloud for scalable and efficient cloud-native application management.
6. **Testing**: Ensured robust testing of endpoints using `curl` commands and other testing frameworks.

### Implementations

- **Data Modeling**: Designed two versions of data models. The initial version used a nested document structure, which was later optimized to improve read and write operations.
- **API Development**: Created RESTful API endpoints to handle CRUD operations efficiently, closely following the RESTful functionalities of Firebase.
- **Rules Configuration**: Implemented server-side logic for rules configuration to set and modify indexes, ensuring optimal performance and data integrity.
- **Server-Side Logic**: Implemented complex data filtering and querying to optimize performance.
- **Deployment and Testing**: Deployed the application using Docker, ensuring it is easily portable and manageable across different environments. Conducted extensive testing to ensure reliability and performance.

### Purpose of RESTful API Endpoints

- **GET**: Retrieve data from the database with support for complex filtering and querying.
- **POST**: Create new entries in the database with a flexible data structure.
- **PUT**: Update existing entries with new data, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- **PATCH**: Partially update specific fields in an existing entry.
- **DELETE**: Remove entries from the database securely and efficiently.
- **Rules Configuration**: Set and modify indexes to optimize query performance and maintain data integrity.

### Summary

FireMongo aims to bridge the gap between Firebase Realtime Database's JSON structure and MongoDB's powerful querying capabilities, while emulating the RESTful functionalities of Firebase. By leveraging the strengths of both databases, this project provides a robust backend solution for managing complex data operations. The RESTful API endpoints offer a flexible and efficient way to interact with the database, making it a versatile tool for developers. The project's deployment using Docker and Okteto Cloud ensures scalability and ease of management, making it suitable for various application needs.

<!-- This project is a REST API for storing and retrieving data documents. It allows
users to create new data documents by sending a POST request to the API
endpoint.

The API supports the creation of multiple data documents at once, each
identified by a unique ID. The created documents are stored in a MongoDB
database.

The API also supports retrieving data documents by their ID, using a GET request
to the appropriate endpoint. The project uses Python and the FastAPI web
framework, with asynchronous programming using the asyncio library. It also uses
the PyMongo library for interfacing with MongoDB.

The API includes error handling and input validation to ensure data integrity
and prevent unexpected errors. -->

# Getting Started

## Setup of development environment

1. Create a new Python environment and activate.

    **Conda** (from scratch)

    ```bash
    export PYTHON_VERSION=3.10.10
    conda create --name fastapi python=PYTHON_VERSION
    conda activate fastapi
    ```

    **Conda environment.yml file**

    ```bash
    conda env create -f conda-environment.yml
    ```

    **Virtual environment**

    ```bash
    python -m venv ENV
    source ENV/bin/activate
    ```

2. Install dependencies in your environments

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

## Setup Environment Variables for the App

### Requirements

-   You need have you own MongoDB Atlas Cluster
-   Get the connection details including the URI, username and password

### Creating a .env file

-   Create a new environment file named `.env`
-   Copy the environment variables from `example.env` file from the root
    directory and paste it into the `.env` file created above
-   Add the MongoDB Atlas URI with username and password next to the
    `MONGODB_URI` environment variable
-   To generate a the secret key, run the following command:
    ```bash
    openssl rand -hex 32
    ```

## Run the APP

### Locally

Run the command below in the terminal

1. Linux

    ```bash
    scripts/server.sh
    ```

2. Windows

    ```cmd
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

3. Run with Uvicorn multiple workers

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
    ```

4. Run with Gunicorn & Uvicorn
    ```bash
    gunicorn app.main:app --workers 4 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```

## Deploy

## Deploy on Docker

-   Build the docker image with the following tag

    ```bash
    docker build . -t {DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}/firebase-realtime-db-emulator:latest
    ```

-   Create and run the container

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

## Deploy on Okteto

```bash
okteto login
okteto deploy --build
```
