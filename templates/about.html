            <p class="lead">
                The theme of this semesterâ€™s project was emulation where the goal was to develop a
                prototype system that emulates the interface and working of a big data system.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Here I have emulated Firebase Realtime Database RESTful API using FastAPI as framework and MongoDB Atlas
                as a database. This system implements the functionality of RESTful endpoints GET, POST, PUT, PATCH &
                DELETE with filters associated with that endpoints. It tries the replicate the most of the
                functionalities as accurately as possible with some assumptions.
